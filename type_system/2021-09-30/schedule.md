- Diffing for error message, step 3 (Florian Angeletti)
- Extending levels to HO polymorphism
- More abstractions for unifiable nodes: `field_kind`/`commutable` [#10541](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10541) and `row_field` [#10627](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/10627) (Jacques)
- Rewrite `Ctype.subst` to use matching rather than unification, removing mutual recursion (Jacques)
